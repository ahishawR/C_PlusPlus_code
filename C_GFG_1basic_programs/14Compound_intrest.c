/*Formula to calculate compound interest annually is given by: 
Amount= P(1 + R/100)t

Compound Interest = Amount â€“ P
Where, 
P is principal amount 
R is the rate and 
T is the time span

Input: Principal (amount): 1200
                    Time: 2
                    Rate: 5.4
Output: Compound Interest = 133.099243*/


// float p,r,t,amount;
// printf("enter value of rate and time and principle ");
// scanf("%f%f%f",&r,&t,&p);
// amount=p*(1+r/100)*t;
// printf(" amount %f",amount);
// return 0;


// C program to calculate Compound Interest

// Calculating compound Interest
